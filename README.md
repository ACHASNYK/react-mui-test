Hi to all. This is a test project with React , Material UI.

Table building logic is to check and validate incoming data for consistency and to build a table accordignly.

The challenge was to create a pop-up window from a cells with a value using window.open method of WEB Api and to render another React component there.

This is achieved by React Portal function and children.props.
